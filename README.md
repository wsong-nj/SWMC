SWMC (SWMC+) is a DAG (scientific workflow) discovery approach, which can discover the DAG model from the corresponding event logs. SWMC+ can also discover the DAG protocol (public view) from public event logs in clouds. 

If you want to use the code as well as the data set in your research, you can cite these two papers. Thanks.
