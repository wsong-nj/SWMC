Please follow steps below to use the tool "SWMC+.jar ":

1. Open the SWMC+.jar File and select the corresponding action -- SWMC+ Mining or Workflow Protocol Mining in the menu bar(cf. g1.png).

2. If "SWMC+ Mining" is chosen, add file in ../Demo/SWMC+ (cf. g2.png).

3. Click "Mining" button to start mining; click "DAG" button to display the mining results as a PNG picture.(cf. g3.png). 

4. If "Workflow Protocol Mining" is chosen, add event log file in ../Demo/Workflow Protocol Mining and add communicating activities via .txt file(cf. g4.png).

5. Click "Source DAG" button to show the picture of origin workflow; click "Algorithm1" or "Algorithm2" button to use different algorithm to excute workflow protocol mining and click the corresponding "DAG1" or "DAG2" button to display the mining results as a PNG picture.(cf. g5.png). 

Note, if you want to generate PNG file, you need to install Graphviz.msi in your computer first. Only in this way, can you get the discovered scientific workflow in the SVG format (10.svg, for example).
